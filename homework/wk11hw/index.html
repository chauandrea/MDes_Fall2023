            <p>Going through this project, I was quite confused on how to begin. I decided the best action was to consult how others conducted pendulum based artwork. I decided instead after some time to focus on rotational based work and began implementing color changes with each variation. I made sure to change the style by making it larger without creating too many rotations but focusing on an inner design on a circular rotation. I didn't create 6 here since I decided to keep the design within the image but each variation has different colors to showcase different feelings.  </p>
