        <p>When I was first starting, I had no idea what I wanted to make. I was having troubles on showcasing my idea. </p>

            <p>How I began my process was by analyzing. What exactly did I want to make. After much analyses, I discovered one artist's variation on microbioms. They created an interesting variation of bioms as if on a petri plate. From there, I analyzed their code and played with the numbers to create a new image altogether. I wanted to attempt creating butterflies with the lines and after many different variations and attempts after changing the different variables, I began to notice a change from the lines turning squiggly and then turning the lines into tiny line squiggles. </p>
            <img src="red sketch.png" alt="Red Butterflies" id="c1" class="largeImg">

            <p> After much trial and error, the design began to take place and I decided to create two variations with a blue style and a red style. The red style was inspired by certain red and silver butterflies. The colors soar around the page and are randomized by the generator. I made sure to not have them as too big on the page while also making them large enough to have multiple on the page. Each time the design is iterated, it will randomize across the screen showing different designs.   </p>
        
            <h3>Restart</h3>
            <p>I had many complications with my code and in the end could not recreate the image to exactly how I wanted it to look like prior. I started by taking a look originally at microbioms but in the end I really could not find their code to see how to imitate it and had to start from scratch. I began by first taking a look at it instead as paint swatches and created lines. These lines would change and intersect with each other or change colors through a randomized generator. Each of the strokes would repeat different variations everytime it's clicked. It doesn't look the same as above but it is creating a pattern with stroke swatches instead of lines. </p>
