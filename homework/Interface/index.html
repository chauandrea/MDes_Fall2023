            <p>When I was first trying to figure out what I wanted to do, I thought of about 3 different ideas utilizing the teachable machine model. The first idea was creating a game with the computer where you play rock, paper scissors. The second idea I thought of was creating a dice game with the computer saying who will roll the highest. The last idea that I had was creating a lameman's version of Tears of the Kingdom, which is a recently released game where you are able to fuse two items together to essentially create a new item.</p>

            <p>Going through the process of conducting the research for these three was quite difficult since there were many possibilities at steak. This included not being able to let the game work with other participants due to the background being different. Another setback was that people may have different hands or objects in their inventory. I also had different dices that I was going to use at first when I first started my teachable machine but after much dicusssion with the professor, I decided to focus on creating a pseudo Tears of the Kingdom game. </p>
