            <p>When I was first trying to figure out what I wanted to do, I thought of about 3 different ideas utilizing the teachable machine model. The first idea was creating a game with the computer where you play rock, paper scissors. The second idea I thought of was creating a dice game with the computer saying who will roll the highest. The last idea that I had was creating a lameman's version of Tears of the Kingdom, which is a recently released game where you are able to fuse two items together to essentially create a new item.</p>

            <p>Going through the process of conducting the research for these three was quite difficult since there were many possibilities at steak. This included not being able to let the game work with other participants due to the background being different. Another setback was that people may have different hands or objects in their inventory. I also had different dices that I was going to use at first when I first started my teachable machine but after much dicusssion with the professor, I decided to focus on creating a pseudo Tears of the Kingdom game. </p>

            <p> I first created a couple different categories and took images in many different lightings and focusing it on white as much as I could since most people would have a white surface. I chose: pen, paper, lighter, apple, orange. I was hoping with this I can create a few things.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>With Pen and Paper, I can create a sword and have it mean: the pen is mighter than the sword.</li>
                <li>With paper and a lighter, you can create a fire allowing you to supposedly cook food.</li>
                <li>With a pen and a lighter, You now have a fire weapon, You can now battle with a firey staff.</li>
                <li>With an apple and an orange, you can make a salad if you're hungry.</li>
                <li>Putting an apple or an orange with a lighter would make roasted food or pies.</li>
                <li>Putting an apple or an orange with a pen would created tanghulu. A sugar dessert from Asia.</li>
                <li>Putting an apple or an orange with paper would create a rock.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>With these combinations you can then roam successfully around Tears of the Kingdom, if I can successfully create this. The problem is now implementing it.</p>

            <p>I first started by creating the different items in Google's Training Machine and put multiple inputs. The errors already began. Paper was registering as the background instead of a piece of paper. Pen is not always recognized and is seen as paper more often. I was trying to see, should I use this to my advantage or just leave it be. I then decided, as of now, let's focus on makiing an inventory to take in the information that is being collected. </p>
