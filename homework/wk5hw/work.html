                “We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But a digital product is not the same as a printed product.” </b></h4>
                
                I agree with this statement due to how digital devices are really not the same as printed products. It's the same as some people can draw or design digitally but they may not be able to do it on physical pieces of paper. There are many nuances that make the two mediums so different and that also inherently makes designing for both ways not the same and yet we still like to perceive it as the same idea.

                "What happens when we try to redefine the graphic design curriculum using a programming language as the tool for the designer?" </b></h4>
                
                This was such an insightful way of looking at things since I started in a design background and went into a very intense technical background from studying python, java, scheme, etc. and learning how to incorporate that into designs. It was a very different way of seeing design and it helped me analyze the designs that I wanted to create in a more unique manner while understanding how it could be created even when there may or may not be limits.

            <h4><b>
                "There is a need for educational material that teaches the fundamentals of graphic design in a modern way, especially if it also gives students mental models for critiquing digital design projects."</b></h4>
                
                A lot of people come into the design space expecting that they could easily transition into the space and design. However, it's not as simple as it appears to be due to the different nuances that appear. It is true and necessary to teach individuals graphic design for digital products rather than designing for physical. The two pieces make and help designers grow and learn how to make each piece more unique to users and viewers.

        <h3>What do Prototypes Prototype? by Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill</h3>
        <p>
            <h4><b>
                "Finally, prototypes are not self-explanatory: looks can be deceiving. Clarifying  what aspects of a prototype correspond to the eventual artifact -and what don't- is a key part of successful prototyping."</b></h4>
                
                This statement of looks can be deceiving is an interesting way of describing prototypes. Prototypes as explained in the text can be seen in many different ways in different professions and purposes and due to that can provide a very skewed vision of expectations. Prototyping can be congruent to many forms of 'showcasing a product' and even though the statement was focused on the element that it varies per user, the final outcome of a prototype can be considered deceiving as that will not be the actual final outcome majority of the time. Many iterations will occur and what we perceive as what we want the outcome to be will not even be the outcome and what is capable making the expectations of the prototype also deceiving.

            <h4><b>
                “We define the dimensions of the model as role; look and feel; and implementation. Each dimension corresponds to a class of questions which are salient to the design of any interactive system...The triangle is drawn askew to emphasize that no one dimension is inherently more important than any other."</b></h4>
                
                Having a model focused these three aspects provides new meanings to design. There is normally a certain hierarchy and focus presented on designs and how they should be designed. Sometimes the role is pushed as the main focus of the design rather than the implementation and the look and feel. It's important to understand that each element is what makes a design and a prototype unique and useful. If the implementation of a prototype is not there, then why was it created other than the looks and role. Depending on who the stakeholder is, one element may be kicked out of the triangle making it a line or a circle focused on one item. It is crucial to see each element and educate designers and others in the pipeline the focus and crucial needs for each element.         
        </p>

            <h4><b>
                “By focusing on the purpose of the prototype-that is, on what it prototypes--we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build. With a clear purpose for each prototype, we can better use prototypes to think and communicate about design.”</b></h4>
                
                Many times when presenting prototypes, it is understandable that the audience may not know the full purpose or what it is trying to solve. This statement and throughout the article, it proved that it is crucial to showcase to your team, why this was necessary and how you went about it. Without the extra care taken to educate your team on the problem and goal of the project, the prototype becomes useless in their hands until the know the reason behind it.
