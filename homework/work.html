        <p class="first">
            With my degrees in Cognitive Science and Art Practice from UC Berkeley, I wanted to combine my specialities to create impactful designs. With the artistic focus on people's psyche, I want to continue to focus on creating work focused on and made for people. With this intent, I am going forward telling more stories that are made intuitively for each person.

            When I'm not working, I'm drinking tea. I love buying tea from many parts from around the world and learning about the effects of tea.
